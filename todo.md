# tkWiki TODO list 


 - The crumbs are not working correctly with the Home link. We need to 
   look into this
 - Fix the template to work with the LG Chrome mobile, it is not correct
 - Add LDAP adapter to the Wiki for AD system implementation
 - We need to fix the SQL order for when installing a new site, as its broken because of   
   conflicts with base libs.
