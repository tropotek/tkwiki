# TODO 


- We may need to store the crumbs in the  query string after all, when using the back button we loose 
the string and that make it useless, it also will happen for every page that relies on the query string...
BUGGER!!!!!!!!!!!

- Standard registered users should only be allowed to view pages, all edit controls should be hidden.
This will allow us to create public websites with registered users. Just need to change the templates.
- Update breadcrumbs, would be nice to have it work as default for system pages, 
but then have a separate crumb for wiki pages that works as a carousel (see current wiki)
- TinyMCE has an invisible function, to edit the page, this could be an interesting way to 
edit the content only (is no page settings)
- get a bootstrap 5 jquery image/file viewer (lightbox style)

- Also I think it`s time to create some sort of account record implementing the Authtool (See BTC site), This would be handy
as the wiki is used primarily to save external account info, ensure they have categories and permissions.
Maybe they can be attached to pages as well so the can be listed in related pages. Could have a widget that shows the
passcode and details inline to avoid password data being show accidentally???


## DONE

- REMOVE ALL files and start from scratch with the new tk8base project...
- All information and actions for pages should be in the info menu button dropdown
- Use tabs for the edit page, and page view permissions should have explanations
- Re-create the buttons for tinymce
- Add stylesheets to tinymce and make formatting as close to site render as possible
