# TODO 

- REMOVE ALL files and start from scratch with the new tk8base project...

- Standard registered users should only be allowed to view pages, all edit controls should be hidden.
This will allow us to create public websites with registered users. Just need to change the templates.
- All information and actions for pages should be in the info menu button dropdown
- Use tabs for the edit page, and page view permissions should have explanations, consider re-introducing groups???
- Add reset crumb to page settings
- Re-create the buttons for tinymce
- Add stylesheets to tinymce and make formatting as close to site render as possible
- Add a release lock button in the actions dropdown
(release the edit lock, as sometimes this can be an issue,
bring up a confirmation with a warning on what can happen when 2 people are editing the same page)
- In page settings we could add options to show: contributors, created, modified, permissions, revision ID?
- Also I think it`s time to create some sort of account record implementing the Authtool (See BTC site), This would be handy
as the wiki is used primarily to save external account info, ensure they have categories and permissions.
Maybe they can be attached to pages as well so the can be listed in related pages. Could have a widget that shows the
passcode and details inline to avoid password data being show accidentally???
- get a bootstrap 5 jquery image viewer (lightbox style)
